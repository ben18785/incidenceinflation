\usage{
observed_cases_single(
  I_observed,
  I_true,
  day_2,
  day_1,
  day_onset,
  delay_parameters
)
}
\arguments{
\item{I_observed}{observed case count for cases originating on day_onset on
day_1}

\item{I_true}{true case count originating on day_onset}

\item{day_2}{day of last observation: day_2 > day_1 >= day_onset}

\item{day_1}{day of first observation: day_1 >= day_onset}

\item{day_onset}{day when case originates}

\item{delay_parameters}{named list of 'mean' and 'sd' of gamma distribution
characterising the reporting delay distribution}
}
\value{
a count representing number of cases reported between day_1 and day_2
}
\description{
The number of cases originating on day_onset which are subsequently reported
between day_1 and day_2 is modelled as a binomial distribution:
\deqn{I_reported\sim binomial(I_true-I_observed, p_detect)}
where I_observed is the number of cases originating on day_onset reported on
day_1; p_detect is the probability a case was undetected on day_1 but
is detected by day_2.
